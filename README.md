Hey. My name is Hamza.
This is Assignement # 1 in which we are asked to develop a website using Bootstrap.
Assignement # 1 include 4 files
1. index.php // responsible for running the html page on the browser
2. index.html // it contains the code of the structure of website and also include the Bootstrap classes for styling
3. Images // images is a folder that contains all the images used in the website
4. composer.json // this is json file which is empty.

Thank You.
